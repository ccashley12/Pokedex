This simple JavaScript app is a Pokémon index. You can click each Pokémon listed and a modal will pop up with details and images of  each Pokémon. You can also search for Pokémon by name in the search bar.

This app fetches data from an API. I have utilized in this project JS, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and ESLint.
